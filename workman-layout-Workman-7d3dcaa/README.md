Workman keyboard layouts
========================

Workman keyboard layout originally proposed by OJ Bucao at http://www.workmanlayout.org.

When learning cold-turkey, try printing the included keyboard image as a desk reference.

## Important design notes

The original Workman-P proposal by OJ Bucao sought to reverse keys for backtick (`) and brackets ([]), however when considering the Objective-C and PHP programming languages, both make heavy use of the original, primary characters. Swapping them makes those frequent characters more work. **In this repository, only the number keys are reversed** to special characters.

Some of the original key mapping files written by OJ used Colemak positions for alternate/multi/dead key configurations, therefore all the configurations proposed by OJ on his wordpress blog have been modified and bug-fixed by David Norman and hosted at http://github.com/workman-layout/Workman.
