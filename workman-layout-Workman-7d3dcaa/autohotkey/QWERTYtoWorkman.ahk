; Workman layout for AutoHotkey (MS Windows)
; 2017-03-07 Joel May.  Public domain.
; See http://www.autohotkey.com/ for more information

; Based on Colemak AutoHotkey script from https://colemak.com/Windows by Shai Coleman.

; For this to work you have to make sure that the US (QWERTY) layout is installed,
; that is set as the default layout, and that it is set as the current layout.
; Otherwise some of the key mappings will be wrong.
;
; This is mainly useful for those who don't have privileges to install a new layout
; This doesn't support the international features of the Colemak layout.

#SingleInstance force
#NoEnv ; Recommended for performance and compatibility with future AutoHotkey releases.
SendMode Input ; Recommended for new scripts due to its superior speed and reliability.
SetTitleMatchMode 3  ; Exact matching to avoid confusing T/B with Tab/Backspace.
